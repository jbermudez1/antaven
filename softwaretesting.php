                  The constant technological development growth and the need to rely on high quality software products often causes companies to incur in large expenses related to staff hiring, training of existing staff, as well as the dedication of valuable time to research and development. <br><br>
                  The outsourcing of infrastructure, human resources and testing tools enables clients to maximize the benefits of having a testing area, without incurring costs in maintenance, planning complexity, execution and human resources availability. For those companies that do not want to have an inhouse testing area and prioritize cost reduction and the high professionalism of human teams, Antaven proposes the outsourcing of services related to “Project Testing.” <br><br>
                  Antaven's Nearshore Software Testing Service provides a level of confidence in the software, ensuring that the software is tested, has an acceptable defect rate, and high quality. It is an integral and critical phase of software development project. Antaven's domain experience makes it a recognized name for nearshore software testing.

            <div class="tit">TESTING TYPES </div>
            The different software tests, carried out in all phases of the life cycle, guarantee the delivery to production of an application with a minimum number of faults and, eventually, none. This increases the reliability of the development areas and the satisfaction of users. Vates S.A. offers different types of software testing among which we can mention: 
                <br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                  <span class="tit2">FUNCTIONAL TESTING:</span><br>
                  It focuses on verifying if the software complies with the approved specifications through the use of a wide variety of scenarios that include normal and faulty input ranges, interface testing, security control. 
                  <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">REGRESSION TESTING:</span><br>
                It tests all the software functionalities through the different test cycles and even accelerates the testing execution times by means of automated tools.
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">COMPATIBILITY TESTING:</span><br>
                 It ensures that the software is compatible with certain versions of operating systems, web servers, databases, and other components that constitute the application architecture. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">PERFORMANCE TESTING:</span><br>
                It verifies response time, consumed resources, bottlenecks and resources available in the normal operation of the application. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">STRESS TESTING:</span><br>
                It overloads your software to verify its behavior regarding concurrency, error handling and consumed resources. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">LOAD TESTING:</span> <br>
                End to end performance tests under anticipated production load. The primary objective of this test is to determine the response times for various time critical transactions and business processes and that they are within documented expectations (or Service Level Agreements – SLAs 
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">VOLUME TESTING:</span> <br>
                Volume testing is done against the efficiency of the application. Huge amount of data is processed through the application (which is being tested) in order to check that the system response times meet performance measures defined as part of the non-functional requirements specifications.
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">CODE UNIT TESTING:</span> <br>
                testing of individual pieces of code to determine if they are fit for use, which are later assembled in an application. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application.

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                <span class="tit2">WHITE BOX TESTING:</span> <br>
                It checks the application code, making sure that it complies with the coding standards and best practices stated by the organization.
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">USABILITY TESTING:</span> <br>
                It ensures that the application is designed according to basic usability considerations. This type of testing includes documentation that contains recommendations about ergonomics and navigability characteristics in accordance with international standards, which define guidelines for such purpose.
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">SECURITY TESTING:</span> <br>
                A process to determine that an information system protects data and maintains functionality as intended.The six basic security concepts that need to be covered by security testing are: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non-repudiation.
                <br><br>
                <span class="tit2">WEB TESTING:</span> <br>
                Web Testing is the name given to software testing that focuses on web applications. Complete testing of a web-based system before going live can help address issues before the system is revealed to the public. Among the most important aspects to be covered in web testing are: <br><br>
                <ul>
                   <li><b>Functionality Testing:</b> tests links, forms, cookies, databases, and html/css. </li>
                   <li><b>Usability testing:</b> checks for navigation, content and other user information for help.</li>
                   <li><b>Interface testing:</b> web server, application server and database server interfaces. </li>
                   <li><b>Compatibility testing:</b> browser compatibility, operating system compatibility, mobile browsing, and printing options. </li>
                   <li><b>Performance testing:</b> web load testing and web stress testing. </li>
                   <li><b>Security testing:</b> tests several issues related to web security such as: </li>
                     <ol>
                       <li>Try some invalid inputs in input fields like login username, password, and input text boxes<li>Check the system reaction on all invalid inputs. </li>
                       <li>Web directories or files should not be accessible directly unless given download option.</li> 
                       <li>Test by pasting internal url directly into browser address bar without login. Internal pages should not open.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-7">
                Network Testing is the actual measurement and recording of a network's state of operation over a period of time. On the other hand, distributed testing can be basically understood as test cases consisting of two or more parts that interact with each other; each part being processed on a different system. It is the interaction between the different test case components that sets distributed testing apart. Typically it is this interaction between different computer systems that is under test.

              test scenarios. </li>
              <li><span class="tit2">Test execution:</span> This involves executing the software based on the test plans and test cases. </li>
              <li><span class="tit2">Test reporting:</span> Generation of metrics and making final reports on their test results. </li>
              <li><span class="tit2">Re-testing the defects:</span> Thorough testing of the software again after the developers have fixed the bugs.</li>
