                  <br><br>
                  <p>These differences have their origin in their business features and particularities and, 
                  definitively, in the reality of the market they belong to. 
                  At Vates, we believe in quality conceived as the satisfaction of our clients' 
                  needs; thus, our application development service centers on creating quality 
                  solutions that meet the specific needs of every client, its market and its business strategy. </p>

            <p class="tit">What is a customized development?</p>
            <p>A customized development is the creation of a software product based on the client's particular specifications. In this way, the product is adapted to the client's needs and not vice-versa, as commonly occurs with the acquisition of commercial software packages. Therefore, a clear identification of the client's needs and the corresponding translation in software specifications is required. 
            <br><br>
            To create a customized development, it is necessary to define a project that engenders a software product with the identified features. 
            </p>
            <p class="tit">What is a Project?</p>
            <p>A Project is an organized undertaking to accomplish a specific goal in a determined time. Each project is unique, although similar projects may exist. 
            <br><br>
            <p><b>PROJECT FEATURES: </b></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><p><span class="tit2">Time is reduced.</span><br>
                It has an established beginning and end. <br>
                It has defined and measurable deliverables, whether they are products, services or results.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li><p><span class="tit2">Progressive construction.</span><br>
                Its development is done in stages and with successive increments. It differs from "continuous work" in that the project has a specific start and end date and work schedule.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
